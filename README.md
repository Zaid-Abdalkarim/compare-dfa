# Instructions on using DFA Compare

0. install npm and Node JS
1. Run this command `npm install` then `npm start`
2. After building user, you, should now be able to drag out the `START` Node and create a DFA.
3. the `START` Node must be `FIRST` dragged out before any other nodes. 
4. connections between the nodes is done by clicking and dragging the `BLACK` portion of the Node, on the outside, and dragging the arrow that will appear to another node or the same node itself. (Dragging it to itself is a little cumbersome but it does work.)
5. After creating the first DFA go ahead and create the second DFA at the bottom. the first and second DFA CANNOT be connected or the program will not work.
6. After creating both DFAs click on the `Compare DFA's` Button, located at the top of the screen.
